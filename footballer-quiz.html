      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">
        Effective date: <strong>[DATE]</strong><br/>
        App: <strong>[APP NAME]</strong><br/>
        Developer: <strong>[DEVELOPER / COMPANY NAME]</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>[APP NAME]</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and shares
        information when you use our mobile application (the “App”).
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We use third-party services such as <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads.</li>
        <li>We may use analytics and diagnostics tools (e.g., <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong>, <strong>Crashlytics</strong>) to improve app performance.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> knowingly collect personal information such as your name, email, or phone number.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        The App itself does not require you to create an account and does not ask for your name, email address, or phone number.
        However, some data may be collected automatically through third-party SDKs integrated into the App.
      </p>

      <h2>Automatically Collected Data (via third-party SDKs)</h2>
      <p>Depending on your device settings and consent, the following data may be collected:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong> (e.g., Advertising Identifier / IDFA, IDFV) for advertising and measurement.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage data</strong> (e.g., app interactions, session duration, screens viewed) for analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong> (e.g., crash logs, performance metrics) to improve stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> (in some cases inferred from IP for ad delivery, typically at country/region level).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tracking & Personalized Advertising (ATT)</h2>
      <p>
        We may request permission via Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework to use your device’s advertising identifier
        for personalized ads and ad measurement.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you allow tracking, ads may be more relevant.</li>
        <li>If you deny tracking, you may still see ads, but they may be less personalized (non-personalized ads).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To deliver and measure advertisements.</li>
        <li>To understand app usage and improve user experience.</li>
        <li>To diagnose crashes and performance issues.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        We use third-party SDKs/services that may collect and process data as described above. These services have their own privacy policies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google AdMob (Google): <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li>Firebase (Google) – Analytics/Crashlytics (if used): <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase Privacy and Security</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Note: If you are not using Firebase Analytics/Crashlytics, you may remove the Firebase bullet above.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information. We may share certain device and usage data with third-party service providers
        (such as advertising and analytics providers) strictly to operate, maintain, and improve the App.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We do not store personal data on our own servers. Third-party providers may retain data according to their own retention policies.
      </p>

      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
        If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can manage tracking permission in iOS: <code>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking</code>.</li>
        <li>You can limit ad personalization from your device settings and Google ad settings where available.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect information processed by the App. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version on this page and update the “Effective date”.
